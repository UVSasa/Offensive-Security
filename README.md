# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Red Team Labs

## Overview

This repo is a structured collection of labs, notes, and walkthroughs designed to practice and document offensive security techniques. The goal is to build hands-on skills in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and red team methodologies.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate endpoint-based attacks (e.g., privilege escalation, process injection, credential access)
- Simulate network-based attacks (e.g., port scanning, man-in-the-middle, data exfiltration)
- Build a personal reference for penetration testing skills
- Simulate real-world attack scenarios in a controlled environment
- Prepare for certifications like OSCP, PNPT, CEH, eJPT

## ‚úÖ Red Team Focus Areas

This repository simulates the methodology of a red teamer across the attack chain:

- **Initial Access** ‚Üí Exploiting exposed services, phishing simulation
- **Reconnaissance** ‚Üí Enumeration of networks, domains, and services
- **Exploitation** ‚Üí Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain a foothold
- **Privilege Escalation** ‚Üí Moving from user ‚Üí admin/system/root
- **Credential Access** ‚Üí Dumping & cracking passwords, harvesting tokens
- **Lateral Movement** ‚Üí Expanding access to other systems in the network
- **Persistence** ‚Üí Ensuring continued access through backdoors & tasks
- **Defense Evasion** ‚Üí Avoiding detection by EDR, SIEM, and logging system

# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Red Team Labs

## Overview

This lab is designed to simulate **realistic cyber attacks** on both **endpoints** and **network environments** in order to develop and demonstrate **Blue Team detection, analysis, and response skills**. It provides a hands-on platform to practice identifying, investigating, and mitigating threats using industry-standard tools and frameworks.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Simulate endpoint-based attacks (e.g., privilege escalation, process injection, credential access)
- Simulate network-based attacks (e.g., port scanning, man-in-the-middle, data exfiltration)
- Use security tools to detect and respond to threats in real-time
- Build and tune detection rules, dashboards, and alerts
- Gain hands-on experience with logs, events, and forensic data

## ‚úÖ Blue Team Focus Areas

- **Log Collection & Analysis**: Forward logs to Wazuh and analyze alerts
- **Detection Engineering**: Write custom rules for suspicious processes and behavior
- **Alert Tuning**: Reduce false positives, increase detection accuracy
- **Forensics & Investigation**: Examine Sysmon, Event Logs, PCAPs
- **Dashboards**: Create visualizations in Kibana for SOC-style monitoring
